<h1>Don't be grumpy!</h1>
<h2>Still looking for a cute title</h2>
<p class="poem">You’re the punchline to my favorite joke,  <br>
With a wit so sharp, it could slice through smoke. <br>  
Your laughter’s contagious, it bubbles and pops,  <br>
Like soda on ice, it never stops.  <br> <br>

In the morning, you’re coffee—strong, bold, and hot, <br>  
And I’m the sleepyhead that you love a lot.  <br>
With every silly quip and each goofy grin,  <br>
You pull me in close, let the fun begin!  <br> <br>

Your tickles are dangerous, they spark quite the thrill,  <br>
Like a rollercoaster ride that gives me a chill.  <br>
With every laugh shared, I can’t help but see,  <br>
You’re the funniest thing that ever happened to me. <br> <br>

And when passion rises, it’s our time to shine, <br>
With teasing touches and your body so fine. <br>
In the glow of a spark, where our passions ignite, <br>
You’re my secret desire, my thrill and my light. <br><br>

So here’s to your humor, it sparkles with mine,  <br>
To the joy and the giggles that make you divine.  <br>
I love how you make me laugh, love, and play,  <br>
You'de be a funny Valentine, look at the signs!  <br><br>
